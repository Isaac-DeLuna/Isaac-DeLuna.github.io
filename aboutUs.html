        <p>In 1989 years ago Greg Foreman left his small fishing town in Japan to study abroad in Charlotte
            and fell in love with the night life of the city. Inspired by the lack of quality 
            food available late at night Mr.Foreman decided to open his own sushi restaurant in the city.
            It was named Yami, meaning darkness or shadow in Japanese, and upon its opening Mr.Foreman declared
            &quotAt Yami all can have shelter and a plate no matter how late!&quot.<br>While we are still open late at night to serve our origional customer base Yami has become a
            a popular spot with the people of Charlotte for dinners, buisness meetings, parties, and more 
            (visit our contact page for reservations or events)
